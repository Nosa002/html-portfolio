<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Nosa Emmanuel and i was born in Firenze, Italy in may 2002. I am a
  secondary school graduate. <br />
  I love football and my favourite team is Fc Bracelona, which has become a mess
  since the departure of Messi, <br />
  but regardless that i still support them.
</p>
<p>
  I want to become a self taught web developer. I recently grew passion for web
  development after a friend introduced<br />
  me to it two years ago, which i have since then become passionate about
  learning and developing in it as a skill.
